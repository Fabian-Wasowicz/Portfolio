                    <p>The Last Knight (TLK) is a first person tower defense game set in a medieval fantasy world. You must defend a castle from oncoming waves of enemies. If either you or the castle loses all its HP, you lose and the game ends.</p>
                    <h3><span>Combat</span></h3>
                    <p>The main method of combat in TLK is with a sword and a bow. The player can swap between these two at any point. The sword can be used at all times, however has limited range. The bow can defeat targets from a range, but requires arrows to shoot. Once you run out of arrows, you cannot use your bow until you acquire more arrows.</p>

                    <p>In TLK, you can craft certain items when you interact with a workbench. This is how you replenish your arrow count. You can also upgrade your weapons to make them stronger if you have the required items.</p>
