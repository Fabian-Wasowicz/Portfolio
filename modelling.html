                    <h3>I am currently learning the Blender program and it is the main software I use to create 3D models.</h3>
                    <p>I am fairly skilled in several aspects of 3D modelling, such as UV unwrapping, texturing, lighting and baking. Below are some examples of models I have created in the last 2 years.</p>
                    <img src="images/Lowpolywallcover.png" alt="">
                    <img src="images/Highpolywallcover.png" alt="">
                    <img src="images/Texturedwallcover.png" alt="">
                    <img src="images/Bakedwallcover.png" alt="">
                    <p>This is a model of a wall cover I made for one of my projects, The Last Knight. I <span>baked the model</span> to add more detail without using too many polys. I created both the low poly and high poly version of the wall cover in Blender. Then, I baked the high poly model onto the low poly model. I used Adobe Substance Painter to texture the model, afterwards I imported the model into my Unity project.</p>
                    <img src="images/LODTrees.png" alt="">
                    <p>For this model, I experimented with making an <span>LOD tree</span>. I wanted the tree model to get less detailed the further away you were from it. This required me to recreate the model 4 times, each being less detailed than the last.</p>
