                <p>I am currently learning C#, which is used in the Unity game engine. I specialise in coding game mechanics, such as player movement or crafting systems. I have been learning C# since September of 2024 at Access Creative College. Below are a few examples of my work.</p>

                <p>This is the script for a crafting menu I made for <span>The Last Knight</span>, which has a crafting mechanic. You need to find resources in a forest to craft items such as arrows.</p>

                <p>This is the script for the interact mechanic. Every frame, a raycast checks to see if there is an object with a script that has a method called "Interact()". If the object does have said script, some text appears at the top confirming you are within range of an interactable object. If you press the "E" key, then you will interact with the object.</p>
