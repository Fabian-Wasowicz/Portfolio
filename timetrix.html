                    <h3>Timetrix is a game I made for my college's game jam in December 2025. The theme of the jam was "Time trial", so my team and I decided to create a parkour speedrunning game. The parkour mechanics were inspired by games such as Titanfall and Rooftops and Alleys. I had the honour of being the team leader for this game jam.</h3>
                    <p>My contributions to the game comprised of coding the mechanics of the game. I created the main movement, the parkour mechanics, gunplay and timer.</p>
                    <h2><span>Parkour</span></h2>
                    <p>There are 2 main parkour mechanics: crouching and wall running/jumping. I created the wall running by shooting a raycast on each side of the player. This raycast checks to see if there is a valid wall on the side and if the player is holding the directional key towards the wall (e.g. there is a wall to the left of the player and they are holding down "A").</p>

                    <h2><span>Gunplay</span></h2>
                    <p>We planned to have enemies in the game, so we required a way to defeat them. I proposed a ranged weapon such as a pistol.</p>
