                    <h3>Timetrix is a game I made for my college's game jam in December 2025. The theme of the jam was "Time trial", so my team and I decided to create a parkour speedrunning game. The parkour mechanics were inspired by games such as Titanfall and Rooftops and Alleys. I had the honour of being the team leader for this game jam.</h3>
                    <p>My contributions to the game comprised of coding the mechanics of the game. I created the main movement, the parkour mechanics, gunplay and timer.</p>
                    <h2><span>Parkour</span></h2>
                    <p>There are 2 main parkour mechanics: crouching and wall running/jumping. I created the wall running by shooting a raycast on each side of the player. This raycast checks to see if there is a valid wall on the side and if the player is holding the directional key towards the wall (e.g. there is a wall to the left of the player and they are holding down "A").</p>

                    <h2><span>Gunplay</span></h2>
                    <p>We planned to have enemies in the game, so we required a way to defeat them. I proposed a ranged weapon such as a pistol. There is a small cooldown every time you click the mouse button, so you can't spam the gun. When you defeat an enemy the overall time decreases, giving you insentive to defeat them as you time will be faster. Unfortunately, the person who was supposed to create the animations and VFX for the game wasn't able to work on the game for several days for personal reasons, so the gun does not have an animation when it shoots, nor does it have a muzzle flash.</p>

                    <h2><span>Level transition</span></h2>
                    <p>There are two levels in Timetrix: a Christmas level and a military level. I created a script to teleport the player to the second level, as well as unload the assets for the first level once they hit the trigger.</p>

                    <p>Timetrix was the first platforming game I created, and I was very happy with how it came out. I got along well with my teammates and we communicated our vision for the game clearly.</p>
