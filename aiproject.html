                    <h3>This project was one I used to learn new systems and mechanics, namely Unity's Navmesh system used for AIs. Another mechanic I implemented was doors that only opened once the player has completed a certain task. In this case, the player needed to find and destroy a number of orbs.</h3>
                    <h2><span>AI navigation</span></h2>
                    <p>The navmesh agent is designed to follow the player, while avoiding obstacles such as walls. The map is designed like a maze with many tight corners, causing a stressful situation where the player doesn't know if the ai will be waiting for them behind a wall.</p>

                    </video>
                    <h2><span>Door opening</span></h2>
                    <p>In order to open the door to the next area, the player must destroy all orbs in a given area to advance.</p>
                    <video controls>
                        <source src="Videos/Door opening.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                    <p>This was fairly simple to code as I used tags and a script to check how many object with a certain tag existed in the scene. If the number of objects was zero, the door object was destroyed.</p>

                    <h2><span>animations</span></h2>
                        <p>This project was the first time i delved into more visual aspects of game design, such as animation and VFX. Shooting the gun will cause a recoil animation, while reloading it will make the gun move down. When shooting, there is also a muzzle flash that appears for a split second.</p>

                        </video>
                        <p>The animator was fairly tricky for me to figure out, due to it being my first time but I eventually got the hang of it.</p>

                        <p>Overall, I learnt plenty of valuable tools and mechanics thanks to this project.</p>
